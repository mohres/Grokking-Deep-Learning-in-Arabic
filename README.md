# Grokking-Deep-Learning-in-Arabic
This project aims to teach the science behind deep learning from the ground up in Arabic. Based on the excellent book "Grokking Deep Learning" by Andrew Trask, the project focuses on building every detail of neural networks from scratch. While it may not use the same examples as the book, it will dive deeper into explaining certain topics.
